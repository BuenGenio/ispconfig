		<summary>Feature rich counter</summary>
		<description>
			BBclone is a web counter written in PHP. It looks similar to
			Big Brother Webstats. But it is not *just* a counter :
			BBClone gives a detailed view of the visitors of your web
			site. It does it by displaying the n-th last users (and the
			data they provided, like their IP, browser and so on) that
			went of the web site, not just showing a number of visitors.
			This is very handy for slow to medium traffic web site
			webmasters that want to see who visit their sites, what
			browser people use, where do they come from etc. Please note
			that it's very design, BBclone is not useful for high
			traffic websites where you only need agregated data.
