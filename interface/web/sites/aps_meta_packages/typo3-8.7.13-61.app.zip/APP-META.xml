		<summary>TYPO3 is the most advanced GPL content management framework available.</summary>
		<description>TYPO3 is developed by the Danish programmer Kasper Skaarhoej. It is the most advanced GPL content management framework available and successfully competes with commercial products sold at US$50,000. TYPO3 is distributed under the GPL license. However, Kasper has expressed certain aims for the system that we ask you to respect (see typo3.com for more information).</description>
